    //      * Containers --> dynamic storage datatypes implemented using template classes !
    //      * Algorithms --> Already written basic algos so that you don't always write ur sorts !
    //      * Iterators --> these are objects pointing to an element in a container ! not a ptr !
    //      * Functions --> used to make template classes callable, didn't understand ?, even I did'nt when I wrote this but I was confident while typing this that I'd take it on ! Keep it up, you'll understand, Idk for whom I'm writing these futuristic comments, as of when I'm typing this, I don't even know STL LOLL !
