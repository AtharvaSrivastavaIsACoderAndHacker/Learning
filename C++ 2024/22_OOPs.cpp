    Class is a telplate to create objects

    Abstraction - simplifying and generalizing hard concepts/internals in a simple manner, hiding unnecessary details for the user 
    Encapsulation - Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot 
    access state values for all of the variables of a particular object. It can be used to hide both members and functions or methods.
    Inheritance - ability to inherit data and methods of parent class to child class
    polymorphism - ability to take multiple forms - eg function overloading !
    Dynamic binding - code which will be run is not known until the program runs !Dynamic binding is a concept in programming where the
    method to be invoked is determined at runtime rather than compile time. The actual method that'll run isn't known until the code runs.
    Message passing - passing messages within objects, typically in the form of method or function calls !
