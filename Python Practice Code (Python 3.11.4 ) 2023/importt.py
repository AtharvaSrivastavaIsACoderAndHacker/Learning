# protip : whenever import a non built-in file or module that is unrecognised, then once check it's code as if it's not containing name == main
# then it can execute some code only if you type import in new file. even a friend can give you a .py file and if he's highly intentional to 
# delete you files then only if you import his file then also it'll execute as his intentions will not put if name == main 
# CHECK UNRECOGNIZED .PY FILES BEFORE IMPORTING
